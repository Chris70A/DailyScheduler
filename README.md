## Description
- Creating a daily planner is a great way to stay organized and achieve your goals. Having a plan can help you stay focused, prioritize tasks, and make sure that important tasks don't fall through the cracks. 
- By having a daily planner, I can easily see what tasks need to be completed, when they're due, and how long they'll take to complete. It also helps you keep track of important events and reminders through local storage.
- It can also help you manage your time more efficiently and ensure that you are making the most of every day.
- I learned that jQuery makes it easy to select and manipulate elements within the HTML document. How to use day.js to color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. 



## Usage

- You can use your daily planner to prioritize your tasks by listing them in order of importance and setting deadlines for when they need to be completed.

- The app also records your task in local storage, when your return, they will always be there.
